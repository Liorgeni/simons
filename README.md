## How to Play

<li>After pressing the "start" button, "simon" will randomly light up one of the four colored tiles and play a corresponding sound.</li>
<li>The player must then repeat the sequence by pressing the same tile that Simon lit up, and then press the next tile in the sequence that Simon lit up. For example, if Simon lit up the green button first, the player must press the green button and then press the next button in the sequence that Simon lit up.</li>
<li>If the player successfully repeats the sequence, simon will add another tile to the sequence, making it longer and more difficult.</li>
<li>If the player makes a mistake and presses the wrong tile, the game will make a "buzzing" sound and the game will end.</li>
<li>The game continues until the player makes a mistake or successfully repeats the entire sequence of tiles that Simon has lit up.</li>
<li>Simon will keep track of your best score, so do your best!</li>
